# EventTrackerProject

# Overview

This program implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality utilizing Spring Data JPA and RESTful services.  I want to have a good structure in place for continuing to learn and code after this bootcamp completes; hence, the title for my app is "AfterBoot."  

# How to Use

# Lessons Learned
