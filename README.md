# EventTrackerProject

# Overview

This program implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality utilizing Spring Data JPA and RESTful services.  I want to have a good structure in place for continuing to learn and code after this bootcamp completes; hence, the title for my app is "AfterBoot."  

# How to Use

# Technologies Used

* Spring Tool Suite
* MySQL Workbench (SQL)
* Atom
* Spring Boot
* Gradle
* Postman
* Java
* Bash Terminal

# Lessons Learned

This project continued to reinforce our learning to work with Object Oriented Programming and introduced working with request mappings, repositories, and services outside of the examples that were provided in our classroom setting.
